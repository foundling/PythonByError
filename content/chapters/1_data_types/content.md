We will work with the following data types in this book. We can divide them into two categories: simple data types and complex data types (although none of them are in fact 'simple').

## Simple Data Types

+ Numeric
    + int
    + float
    + long
+ Logical
    + bool

## Complex Data Types

+ Sequences
    + string
    + tuple
    + list

+ Collections
    + set
    + dict

+ Object Oriented Data Structures
    + class


Here are some brief examples illustrating the use of each of these items:

# Numbers

## The `int` Data Type

    age = 30
    print(age, type(age))
    # 30, int

    print(age + 1)
    # 31
