exercises:
    Six Characters or Less:
        instructions: Go through the items in usernames and pick out the usernames that are 6 characters or less in length. Print the list and past that list into the input field.
        code: |

            usernames = [
                'redsoxfan9000', 
                'djcarl', 
                'donutman', 
                '?uestlove', 
                'bbgun', 
                'rjd2c3po', 
                'videogamez', 
                'lilly99'
            ]

        hints: 
            - You might find the `for` loop useful here
            - Try using some data type to hold intermediate values while you loop through the names.

        answers:
            - '["djcarl", "bbgun"]'

    Even Number of Characters:
        instructions: Do the same as you did in the previous exercise but print only the usernames that have an even number of characters.
        code: |

            usernames = [
                'redsoxfan9000', 
                'djcarl', 
                'donutman', 
                '?uestlove', 
                'bbgun', 
                'rjd2c3po', 
                'videogamez', 
                'lilly99'
            ]

        hints: 
            - Try using some data type to hold intermediate values while you loop through the names.
            - A number is even if it has a remainder of 0 when divided by 2.  "%" is the operator to get the remainder, e.g. "a mod b" gives you the remainder when "a" is divided by "b".  

        answers:
            - '["djcarl", "donutman", "rjd2c3po", "videogamez"]'
