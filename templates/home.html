    <h2>The Mission</h2>
    <p>Python by Error is a web textbook that takes an error-first approach to teaching Python.  Python was my first programming language and when I started getting serious about it, errors freaked me out. The truth is, it took a long time before I realized how important they were to my self-actualization. What wisdom did I not gain! How much fun I did but didn't have?!?!? We're going to start off by dealing intimately with error messages so we can learn how to think in Python and become fearless in the process.  Follow me down the stack trace!</p>
